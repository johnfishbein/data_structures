In this lab, I struggled a lot with reading in and analyzing the input.  It took me a while to understand the syntax of reading input in c++ and I still don't get it 100%. I spent a while on google, looking up c++ documentation and eventually I figured it out.  The theory behind implementing the stack wasn't too tricky for me to understand, but the syntax took me a while to get.
